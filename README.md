1. **Intake**
2. **Assignment & Communication**
3. **Working on the Issue**
4. **Resolution**

### 1. Intake

Here, a new ticket is born. You can either fill out a form or send an email. Just provide your contact details, describe the issue, and give all necessary information.

### 2. Assignment

After submission, the ticket goes to an IT expert. They might adjust its severity. For instance, in this case, the Priority is set to "Emergency" and assigned to "Jane Doe" from the "System Administrators" department.

### 3. Working on the Issue

The IT team now dives into the problem. They'll update the Ticket Thread with any changes, ensuring everyone stays in the loop.

### 4. Resolution

Once fixed, the ticket is closed. In osTicket, it moves from Open to Closed. It's essential to know where these closed tickets are, as they can be references for future issues.
